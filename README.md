# Planner

This project provides a simple helicopter route planner. The application is now packaged as a small Flask web app located in the `myapp` directory.

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r myapp/requirements.txt
python myapp/app.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.

A `Dockerfile` is also provided for deployment to Cloud Run or any container platform.
